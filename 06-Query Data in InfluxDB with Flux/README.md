## Learning Objective

Flux is the language used to query data that's stored in the InfluxDB time-series engine.
There's an extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code that helps you write Flux queries.

Like many other programming languages, Flux has a set of built-in functions.
There are also add-on packages (sometimes called libraries or modules) that can be consumed by Flux as well.
For example, some importable packages allow you to interact with CSV and JSON-formatted data, or interact with HTTP APIs.
